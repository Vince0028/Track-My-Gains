## 🚀 About The Project

**TrackMyGains** is a modern, dark-themed fitness tracker designed for serious athletes. It manages your weekly workout splits, tracks your progress, and provides instant, factual advice through a built-in **AI Gym Bro Coach**.

Built with performance and aesthetics in mind, it features an "organic" UI design, real-time data syncing, and a strict no-nonsense AI persona.

I use this for my daily workouts.
